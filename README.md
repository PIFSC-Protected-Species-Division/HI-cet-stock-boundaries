# Hawaiian Islands cetacean stock boundaries

This repository contains stock boundaries for five cetacean species with island-associated cetacean populations in the Hawaiian Islands: common bottlenose dolphins, false killer whales, melon-headed whales, spinner dolphins, and pantropical spotted dolphins. The motivation for this repository was to make these stock boundaries accessible to researchers and other users.

The repository includes a folder for each species, with shapefiles containing line features (current projection: WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_4N) included within. All shapefiles were created (from either archived point data or originally) by Amanda Bradford at the NOAA Fisheries Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center. For ease and simplicity, metadata for each shapefile were entered using the "Item Description" style in ArcGIS Desktop, but this may updated in the future. Relevant metadata aggregated by species are included below for ease of viewing.

Downloading individual folders from GitHub is not intuitive. The easiest way to obtain the stock boundaries is to download the repository by clicking on the green "Code" button in the upper right and selecting "Download ZIP". You can then delete the files and folders you do not need. If you have any questions or issues with the boundary files, please contact Amanda Bradford at amanda.bradford\@noaa.gov.

## Bottlenose dolphins

This folder contains stock boundary shapefiles for the four island-associated common bottlenose dolphin populations in the main Hawaiian Islands: the Kauaʻi/Niʻihau, Oʻahu, Maui Nui, and Hawaiʻi Island stocks. These boundaries are based on the 1,000 m isobath. Biological data have suggested that bottlenose dolphins within these boundaries are demographically independent. More information on these boundaries and bottlenose dolphins around the Hawaiian Islands can be found in the latest [stock assessment report](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessment-reports-species-stock).

## False killer whales

This folder contains stock boundary shapefiles for the two island-associated false killer whale populations around the Hawaiian Islands: the endangered main Hawaiian Islands insular and Northwestern Hawaiian Islands stocks. The boundary of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands stock is largely within the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. These boundaries are based on biological data as described in [Bradford et al. (2015)](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/5049). For the Hawaiʻi pelagic stock of false killer whales, there is now an assessment area that extends beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone, which is described in [Oleson et al. (2023)](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/56119), with the underlying data and associated shapefile available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/PIFSC-Protected-Species-Division/HI-Pelagic-FKWs), although the shapefile is also included here for completeness. More information on false killer whales around the Hawaiian Islands can be found in the latest [stock assessment report](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessment-reports-species-stock).

## Melon-headed whales

This folder contains a stock boundary shapefile for the Kohala resident stock of melon-headed whales in the main Hawaiian Islands. This boundary is based on biological data that have suggested a demographically-independent population of melon-headed whales is resident to this area. More information on this boundary and melon-headed whales around the Hawaiian Islands can be found in the latest [stock assessment report](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessment-reports-species-stock).

## Spinner dolphins

This folder contains stock boundary shapefiles for the three island-associated spinner dolphin populations in the main Hawaiian Islands: the Kauaʻi/Niʻihau, OʻahuM/aui Nui, and Hawaiʻi Island stocks, as well as for two stocks in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument: one around Pearl and Hermes (Holoikauaua) and the other around Midway (Pihemanu) and Kure (Moku Pāpapa). The basis for these boundaries is described in [Hill et al. (2010)](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/4423). Biological data have suggested that spinner dolphins within these boundaries are demographically independent. More information on these boundaries and spinner dolphins around the Hawaiian Islands can be found in the latest [stock assessment report](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessment-reports-species-stock).

## Spotted dolphins

This folder contains stock boundary shapefiles for the three island-associated pantropical spotted dolphin populations in the main Hawaiian Islands: the Oʻahu, Maui Nui, and Hawaiʻi Island stocks. These boundaries are based on biological data that have suggested that spotted dolphins within these boundaries are demographically independent. More information on these boundaries and spotted dolphins around the Hawaiian Islands can be found in the latest [stock assessment report](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessment-reports-species-stock).
